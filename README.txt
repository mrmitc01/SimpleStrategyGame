How to Play:
- Energy is the currency used to purchase buildings and upgraded building that you can construct on platforms near your Headquarters. Turrets and Energy Generators are the building types that can be constructed on the gray platforms closest to your Headquarters. Barracks and Vehicle Factories are the building types that can be constructed on the black platforms further from your Headquarters. 

- You can construct a building by left clicking on a platform and selecting the building type you wish to construct. Once a building is constructed, you can click on it again and upgrade it once to make it more powerful. If you do not have enough Energy to construct or upgrade a building, the option will be disabled until you do have enough Energy.

- Energy Generators increase the rate at which you gain energy over time. Turrets defend your Headquarters from attacking forces. Barracks spawn Infantry. Vehicle Factories spawn Vehicles. Infantry and Vehicles move towards the enemy Headquarters and begin attacking it once they are in range. Infantry spawn more quickly, have faster movement speed, have less health, and deal less damage to targets. Vehicles spawn less quickly, have slower movement speed, have more health, and deal more damage to targets.

- In order to win, you must use your Infantry and Vehicle forces to lower the enemy Headquarters health to 0. However, the enemy has all the same options you do in terms of constructing buildings and spawning Infantry and Vehicles. If the enemy forces manage to lower your Headquarters health to 0 first, you lose.

- If your Infantry and Vehicles encounter enemy Infantry and Vehicles, they will attack each other until one of them is defeated. Upgrading a Barracks will allow it to spawn Infantry that have more health and deal more damage. Upgrading a Vehicle Factory will allow it to spawn Vehicles that have more health and deal more damage.
